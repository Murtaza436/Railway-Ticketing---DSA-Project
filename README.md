# Railway Ticketing - DSA Project
 This is a DSA project, worked on C++, on railway ticketing.
This Railway Booking Management System project is designed to allow users to reserve and modify train tickets efficiently. 
It leverages fundamental concepts of C++ along with linked list operations, searching algorithms, and sorting algorithms to handle and display data as per user requirements. 
This implementation serves as a practical application of data structures and algorithms.  

The system is divided into two distinct modules: one for passengers, who can access specific options to manage their bookings, and another for administrators, who must log in to access advanced management features. The process covers all key steps, including entering passenger details, processing payments, generating and printing tickets, and other essential functionalities.
